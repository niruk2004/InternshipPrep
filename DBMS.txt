Database: A database is a collection of related data which represents some aspect of the real
          world.

Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while
considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate
the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the
operating system to provide the specific data.

Database management systems were developed to handle the following difficulties of
typical File-processing systems supported by conventional operating systems.
1. Data redundancy and inconsistency
2. Difficulty in accessing data
3. Data isolation â€“ multiple files and formats
4. Integrity problems
5. Atomicity of updates
6. Concurrent access by multiple users
7. Security problems
