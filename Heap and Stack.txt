Heap Memory

Definition: Heap memory is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. It is managed by the programmer or garbage collector (in languages like Java or Python).

Usage: Objects and data that need to persist beyond the scope of a single function or method are stored in the heap.

Allocation and Deallocation: Memory is explicitly allocated (malloc in C, new in C++/Java) and deallocated (free in C, delete in C++). In managed languages, the garbage collector handles deallocation.

Lifetime: Variables in the heap remain in memory until explicitly freed or garbage collected.

Advantages:
Large storage capacity.
Flexibility for managing data with unknown size or dynamic resizing.

Disadvantages:
Slower access due to the need to traverse pointers.
Potential for memory leaks if memory is not properly deallocated.




Stack Memory

Definition: Stack memory is a region of memory used for static memory allocation and execution of a program's functions, including local variables, function call details, and control flow.

Usage: Stores local variables, function call information, and temporary data.

Allocation and Deallocation: Memory is automatically allocated and deallocated when functions are called and returned.

Lifetime: Variables in the stack are destroyed once the function or block scope ends.

Advantages:
Faster access due to sequential storage and automatic management.
No risk of memory leaks.

Disadvantages:
Limited size (can cause stack overflow for deep recursion or large allocations).
Less flexible as the size must be known at compile time.
